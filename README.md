## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Backend Setup (Crucial Prerequisite)

**This frontend application relies on a separate backend for job scraping, scoring, resume generation, and database operations.**

1.  **Backend Repository**: The backend service is located at [https://github.com/anandanair/linkedin-jobs-scrapper](https://github.com/anandanair/linkedin-jobs-scrapper).
2.  **Fork and Setup**: You **MUST** first fork this backend repository and follow its setup instructions to get the database and backend services running.
3.  **Database**: The backend setup will create and manage the database required by this frontend application.

Once the backend is successfully set up and running, you can proceed with setting up this frontend application.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or later recommended)
- npm or yarn
- A running instance of the backend service from [https://github.com/anandanair/linkedin-jobs-scrapper](https://github.com/anandanair/linkedin-jobs-scrapper).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anandanair/jobs-scrapper-web
    cd jobs-scrapper-web
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add the necessary Supabase credentials:
    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
    ```

### Running the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed and environment variables are set up, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
# yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
